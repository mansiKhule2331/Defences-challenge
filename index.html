    <h2>Principle 1: The Need to Share Information</h2>
    <p>
      The fundamental idea of the Internet is sharing information. 
      Imagine we have information on one computer (<b>Computer A</b>) 
      and we want it to appear on another (<b>Computer B</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest method is carrying a USB drive, but this is slow and doesn’t scale. 
      A better way is to run a cable (Ethernet or Fiber Optic) between them and send signals.
      A high-voltage signal might represent <b>1</b> and a low-voltage <b>0</b>. 
      This gives us the most basic form of networking: a <b>direct link</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Principle 2: The Problem of Scale</h2>
    <p>
      With two computers, direct links are fine. But with three or more, the number of cables grows rapidly. 
      For 100 computers, we’d need 4,950 cables — clearly impractical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is a central device: a <b>Switch</b>. 
      Every computer connects to the switch, and it forwards messages only to the intended machine. 
      We’ve now invented a <b>Local Area Network (LAN)</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Principle 3: The Problem of Connecting Networks</h2>
    <p>
      Suppose one office has its own LAN and another office has theirs. 
      How do they communicate? We can’t connect every computer directly. 
      Instead, we connect the <b>networks</b> using a special device: a <b>Router</b>. 
      A router passes data between networks and finds the best path.
    </p>

    <h2>Principle 4: Making a Global Network</h2>
    <p>
      Now imagine connecting millions of networks worldwide. 
      Routers link together to form a massive web — the <b>Internet</b>.
      Data is broken into <b>packets</b>, each containing the source, destination, and message.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>IP Address:</b> Every device has a unique address (like a home address).</li>
      <li><b>DNS (Domain Name System):</b> Converts human-friendly names (google.com) into IP addresses.</li>
      <li><b>Protocols:</b> TCP/IP ensures reliable communication between devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Principle 5: Why Formats and Standards Matter</h2>
    <p>
      The Internet works because all computers agree on <b>standards</b>. 
      These include formats for audio, video, web pages, and communication protocols. 
      Without common formats, sharing would be impossible.
